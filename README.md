# Group Project: Nuclear Weapons Dataset

This repository contains the code and data for the group project completed during Constructor's data science bootcamp.

We were analyzing nuclear weapons proliferation, the stockpile per country per year and the number of nuclear weapon tests conducted since 1945.

The public interactive chart showing nuclear weapons tests and historical information can be found [here](https://nuclearweapons.streamlit.app/).
